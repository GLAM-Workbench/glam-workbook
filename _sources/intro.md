# Welcome to the GLAM Workbook

This is a companion to the [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.net/). While the Workbench provides *code*, the Workbook explores *context* â€“ how are GLAM collections built and shared, and what does this mean for researchers? 

The Workbook uses digital methods to analyse collections and unpick the meaning of access, but it's not intended as an introduction to digital research in the humanities. The useful resources section lists some alternative starting points.

The content here is divided into bite-sized chunks to make it easy to rearrange and reuse in a variety of contexts. Everything is openly-licensed, so feel free to copy and paste into your own course materials or workshops.
