# About the GLAM Workbook

The GLAM Workbook helps researchers understand the collections of galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (the GLAM sector). GLAM collections are themselves historically contructed, and the interfaces we use to access them can hide as much as they reveal. As researchers we need to ask critical questions about collections and interfaces, just as we would about any historical source. But how? The GLAM Workbook provides a starting point, using digital methods to look behind the interfaces, and create new perspectives on collections. It's aimed both at new and established researchers.
