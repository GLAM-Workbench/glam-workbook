# Using this workbook

The GLAM Workbook isn't intended to be a single narrative, something to be read from start to finish. It's a resource for researchers to dip into, and for teachers to draw on. It's designed as a series of bite-sized chunks to make it easy to rearrange and reuse in a variety of contexts. Everything is openly-licensed, so feel free to copy and paste into your own course materials or workshops.
