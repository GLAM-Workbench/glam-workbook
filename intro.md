# Welcome to the GLAM Workbook

This is a companion to the [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.net/). Here you'll find handy tips, tutorials, and exercises to help you work with digital collections from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (the GLAM sector). 

The content here is divided into bite-sized chunks to make it easy to rearrange and reuse in a variety of contexts. Everything is openly-licensed, so feel free to copy and paste into your own course materials.
